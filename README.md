# Iris flower dataset
Simple iris data set EDA and classification for DSP-IP
During the EDA i noticed :
1. the data is well balanced 
2. we can see a some good classification seperation on the petal width / length visualization (less notices on the sepal width/lenth plot)
3. using the pairplot we can also see some good seperation between septal length / petal length features

i decided to train two well known classifiers using this dataset, Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbors.

Both models preduced perfect accuracy results :)

accuracy_score - Logistic Regression =  1.0
accuracy_score KNN = : 1.0
